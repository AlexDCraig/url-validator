MARIO PLATFORMER TESTING TEAM PLAN - PROJECT REPORT PART 1:

As is, there is no test coverage in this project. This is a project developed by a friend of mine and we plan to use him as a resource if we have any inquiries regarding how the software was intended to work. This is only if anything is unclear, of course. Because there is no testing in the current project, we will be starting from scratch. 

Because the project is written in Java, we will be using Maven and our additional tool/method we will be using will be mutation testing. Maven will be nice because we have been using it all term and it makes for easy unit test development. While we are not as familiar with mutation testing, I think this will be a valuable tool because games are littered with conditional statements that are trying to determine the current state of the game. For instance, checking where Mario is located, where is the terrain, where are the monsters, and most importantly, checking if they are overlapping. 

Each frame of the game is its own testable state. While we are not experienced testers, our plan is to develop tests that check the current state of the game frame-by-frame. By doing this, we can check the adjustments of positions of all of the relevant objects to check if they are in fact responding appropriately to the changes. Furthermore, the mutation testing will go on to test whether the conditional statements in the program have any holes by testing alternative possibilities and if they pass, we may have new possibilities to consider within the conditional statements. 

For any bugs we find, we will be writing bug reports similar to those that we wrote previously in this course. We will do our best to develop a fix for the issue in the short amount of time we have, or at least provide our best guess of what the fix should be. With a fairly large code-base like this, it may be hard for us to entirely wrap our heads around what is being done by each line of code. However, it is well-documented so we will do our best. Lastly, we will try to meet as a group and talk over bugs we find, at which point, the person who found the bug will write the bug report. If a team member finds multiple bugs, and another has not found any, the owner of the bug can pass it over to the other teammate to get a chance to get their hands dirty.
